# r2wars-new

This is a quick and dirty implementation of r2wars for the easterhegg 20
workshops I'm giving (It's currently 01:00 of the day of the workshop and I'm
realizing that the code I wrote about 3 years ago is kind of broken).

```
; CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./... -t 1s -v ./bots/warrior0.asm ./bots/warrior1.as
```
